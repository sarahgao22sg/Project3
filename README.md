### Project Description/Outline: 

    • Analysis of Job Turnover and Separation because of COVID-19 by using Texas Market Data, Covid Tracking Data and Bureau of Labor Statistics.

    • United States and Texas Unemployment Rate Comparison by providing geospatial visualizations specifically delta change per County between July 2019 and July 2020 • Texas Labor Market Analysis for Percent Women and Men COVID Positive Tests with a Line Graph over April 2020 to August 2020 • Total claims for Houston between Jan 2019 to July 2020 with a Line Graph

    • Percent of Unemployment Rate by Men, Women and Teenagers with a Line Graph • Bar graph comparison of Positive Tests Per Month for Texas and New York • Comparing Industry by Industry Annual % Change of Unemployment Rate via Bar Graph • Statistical Analysis

### Research Questions and Answers:

 **Make an Assumption–** 
    1. Unemployment Rates and Claims are directly correlated to COVID-19 cases/deaths (Comparing July 2019 and July 2020 data)

    2. Have any specific industries affected more than others?
    
    3. Which age-group is most impacted?
    
    4. Compare TX and NY and perform t-tests, calculate p-value etc.

 **Data Sets to be Used:** 

     *   Patient COVID-19 Test Results Api.tracking.com 

     *  Daily State (TX & NY) Bureau Labor Statistics (BLS) Data 

     *  (Free API) – version 2 Texas Labor Market Labor Data 


### Conclusions:

    For the months of May through August their is a very strong correlation between between COVID 19 cases and Texas County unemployment data. May being the earliest due to volume of testing being statistically relevant, and August being the latest month for which we had unemployment data.

    We assume that positive COVID 19 cases will go down as parents that were laid off stayed home, to determine would require finding the derivative of the slope over time. From general observation this is the case leading to the conclusion that the less people unemployed led to a lower change in decreasing % positives over time.

    There were more women suffered greater % job losses than men,
    however, teens 16-19 were the highest affected age group. This was the case for both years, leading to the conclusion that the normal state of unemployment spreads from high to low are teens, adult women, adult men.


    There were examples of unemployment % increases, decreases, and stagnation. I would conclude that the effect of unemployment percentage pre and post covid is mostly in magnitude which could be determined by year over comparisons.
